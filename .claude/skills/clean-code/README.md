## Description

Clean Code principles with Java examples: DRY, KISS, YAGNI, naming conventions, function design, code smells, and refactoring techniques.

---

## Use Cases

- "Clean this code"
- "Refactor this method"
- "Improve readability"
- "This function is too long"
- "What should I name this variable?"
- "Is this code too complex?"

---

## Examples

```
> view .claude/skills/clean-code/SKILL.md
> "This method is 100 lines, help me refactor"
→ Identifies code smells, suggests Extract Method, Guard Clauses
```

---

## Principles Covered

| Principle | Key Question |
|-----------|--------------|
| **DRY** | Is this logic duplicated elsewhere? |
| **KISS** | Is there a simpler way? |
| **YAGNI** | Do we need this now or "just in case"? |
