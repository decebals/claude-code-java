            Review this PR for a new or modified Claude Code skill.

            IMPORTANT: Only review files that were actually changed in this PR.
            Run `gh pr diff ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}` to see what was modified.
            Focus ONLY on the changed skill files, not all skills in the repository.

            FIRST: Read these files to understand the validation criteria:
            - docs/SKILL_GUIDELINES.md
            - .claude/skills/README.md (for existing skills list, to check overlap)

            THEN: For each skill file changed in the PR, validate against these criteria:

            ## Structure
            - [ ] SKILL.md exists with frontmatter containing `name` and `description`
            - [ ] README.md exists with human documentation
            - [ ] Follows folder convention: `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/`

            ## No Overlap
            - [ ] Does not significantly overlap with existing skills (check the table in skills/README.md)
            - [ ] If partial overlap exists, the distinction is clear (different level or type)

            ## Clarity
            - [ ] Clear level: micro / meso / macro / framework / cross-cutting
            - [ ] Clear type: audit (review existing code) or template (show how to write)

            ## Quality
            - [ ] Not anemic - has substantive content
            - [ ] Actionable checklists (not vague advice)
            - [ ] Java-specific examples (not generic pseudocode)
            - [ ] Checklist has <15 items

            ## Output Format
            Provide a brief summary:
            1. **Verdict**: APPROVE / REQUEST_CHANGES / NEEDS_DISCUSSION
            2. **Overlap Check**: List any existing skills that might overlap and your assessment
            3. **Issues Found**: Bullet points of what needs to change (if any)
            4. **Suggestions**: Optional improvements (not blockers)

            Be constructive and specific. If requesting changes, explain exactly what needs to be fixed.
